This is You've Gone Incognito's alternative ACM-ICPC reference book.

Hi! We are ":$" (a.k.a "You've Gone Incognito :$"), an ACM-ICPC team.

You can find our main reference book, "Olaf", here: https://github.com/mredigonda/olaf

We'll use this repository for short algorithms that we don't need on the main book but are useful to have at hand.

Feel free to read, copy and use the code here and ask questions if you may :)
